"SRR1132340"	"Illumina HiSeq 1500 paired end sequencing; Merlin re-expression strongly inhibits proliferation of Merlin-deficient cells and this correlates with its ability to regulate a cross-tissue gene expression program. We have shown that Merlin interacts with the PAF1 complex.  ChIP-seq experiments were performed to study how Merlin re-expression regulates the genomewide binding of the PAF1 complex and RNA polymerase II (Pol2) in MDA-MB-231 Merlin deficient breast cancer cells"
